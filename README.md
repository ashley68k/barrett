Or

```

```

Place all those files in the same directory as the barrett executable.

## Building

To build the project, you'll need the SDL2.0 development libraries  
(https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) as well as the SDL_mixer developement  
libaries (https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/, under Binary).

For Linux users, install the respective SDL2 dependencies through your distro's package manager.  
Barrett can be compiled with either GCC or Clang. On Windows, use something such as MinGW's GCC.

This project currently uses CMake. You can create a build target and then build with the commands

```sh
cmake -Bcmake-build-barrett -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S.
cmake --build cmake-build-barrett
```

For CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, please refer to the [CMake docs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html).  
You could alternatively create different build targets for registered, shareware etc.

Please review the CMakeLists.txt file to customize your build options.
